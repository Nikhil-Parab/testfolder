      "Response: Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, and digital information from unauthorized access, damage, theft, or disruption. It involves implementing technologies, processes, and controls to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. Key aspects include:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Risk Management:** Identifying and mitigating potential threats and vulnerabilities.\n",
      "*   **Network Security:** Securing networks through firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and access controls.\n",
      "*   **Endpoint Security:** Protecting individual devices like computers and mobile phones with antivirus software and endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions.\n",
      "*   **Data Security:** Implementing encryption and data loss prevention (DLP) measures to safeguard sensitive information.\n",
      "*   **Incident Response:** Developing plans to effectively respond to and recover from security incidents.\n",
      "*   **Compliance:** Adhering to relevant regulations and standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS).\n",

      "\n",
      "*   **Starting Point:** \"Start here\" - Clearly indicates where to begin.\n",

      "*   **Branching Paths:**\n",
      "    *   \"Learn more about protecting yourself online\" branches into \"Phishing 101\" and \"Cyber security & fraud prevention 102\".\n",
      "    *   \"Learn more about types of scams\" branches into \"Common scams\" and \"Emerging scams\".\n",
      "*   **Demographic Questions:**\n",
      "    *   \"Are you a senior?\" leads to \"Safety for seniors.\"\n",
      "    *   \"Are you a parent?\" leads to \"Safety for kids and teens.\"\n",
      "    *   \"Are you an SME owner or manager?\" leads to \"Cyber security & fraud prevention for SMEs.\"\n",
      "*   **Final Stage:** \"Learning more about how fraudsters and cyber criminals target you\" - The ultimate goal of the flowchart.\n",

      "    *   Arrows indicating the direction of the flow.\n",
      "    *   Boxes with different information.\n",
      "*   **Logos:** The logos of the Canadian Bankers Association are present, indicating the source or endorsement of the information.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Functionality & Purpose:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The flowchart is designed to:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  Introduce basic cybersecurity concepts.\n",
      "2.  Help users identify specific threats (like phishing).\n",
      "3.  Tailor information to specific user groups.\n",
      "4.  Ultimately educate users on how to protect themselves from fraud and cybercrime.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Overall Design:**\n",

      "*   The design is clean and easy to follow.\n",
      "*   The color scheme is consistent and professional.\n",
